"# Beauty-Parlour-Management-System" 
This Project is aimed at developing a web application that depicts online management of beauty parlour. The most aim of the system is to assist the user to book the appointment within the parlour for online.
The users of the system include the customer where they can register initially with the minimum details and will be allowed to make an appointment. The system has user, admin and staff. The user can make a meeting within the parlour and therefore the admin of the system approves it. They will also choose the service which theyâ€™re trying to urge within their specific date and time within the system.
